        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Go to the console to check out what I have coded for this project!</p>
        <p>You will see mathematical operations (well, their answers), and cool stuff!</p>
        <p>Visual Studio Code (VSC) is where you can code anything in HTML, CSS, and JS. You can code in the console, main page, and create awesome functions! Just explore!</p>
